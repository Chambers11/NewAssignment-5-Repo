## Description

The NPC Bar/Saloon, this world was created with a bigger story or game in mind, thus this VR World or scene depicts a playable character entering  the word of non-playable characters when they are not in the a game, or when the gaming console has been turned off. What happens to the NPC’s? Where do they go when the PlayStation/X-box/of PC is turned off? The NPC Bar/Saloon of course! 

Diving in further, the story line trying to be depicted by the brief snippets of dialogue established between the player and the NPC’s, is that of a humorous but also mysterious undertone. The player is on a quest or journey to find his missing son. That is the core component of the story, the tricky or fun part is choosing the right answers in the dialogue to ensure you get to the element of the dialogue faster. Provided you select the right answers, the story wont flow, which is the idea, because all actions have consequences even in the virtual world.
